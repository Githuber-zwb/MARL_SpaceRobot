# SpaceRobotEnv


**SpaceRobotEnv** is an open-sourced environments for trajectory planning of free-floating space robots.
Different from the traditional robot, the free-floating space robot is a dynamic coupling system because of the non-actuated base, as shown in the figure below. 
Therefore, model-based trajectory planning methods encounter many dif- ficulties in modeling and computing. 


Accordingly, the researches focus on how to utilize the model-free methods, like reinforcement learning algorithms, to obtain the trajectory directly. 
However, reaching high-level planning accuracy, bimanual coordination and end-to-end control remains an open challenge for space robotics researchers.
To better help the community study this problem, SpaceRobotEnv are developed with the following key features:
* **Real Space Environment**: we construct environments similar to the space. The free-floating space robot is located in a low-gravity condition.
* **Dynamic coupling control**: Compared with robots on the ground, the torques of joints have a significant impact on the posture of the base. The movement of the base makes a disturbance on the positions of end-effectors, thus leading to a more complex trajectory planning task. 
* **Image input**: We provide the ability to use images as observations. And we also demonstrates our environment is effective, please see [our paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9550509).

Environments of this repo are as follows:
* **SpaceRobotState-v0**
    * State vector contains the angular positions and velocities of joints, the positions and velocities of end-effectors and the positions of goals. The core goal is to make the end-effector reach the goal randomly selected within a large space. 
* **SpaceRobotImage-v0**
    * State vector only contains images information. The core goal is the same as that of the `SpaceRobotState-v0` environment.
* **SpaceRobotDualArm-v0**
    * The free floating space robot owns two robotic arms which are attached with the base. That means two end-effectors are corresponding to two goal positions. 
    When two end-effectors reach the goals together, the task is finished. 


## Installation

Our environment is built on the [Mujoco Simulation](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco). So before using our repo, please make sure you install the [Mujoco](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco) platform.
Additionally, our framework is based on the [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym).
Details regarding installation of Gym can be found [here](https://github.com/openai/gym).

After you finish the installation of the Mujoco and Gym and test some toy examples using them, you can install this repo from the source code:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

We provide a Gym-Like API that allows us to get interacting information. `test_env.py` shows a toy example to verify the environments.
As you can see, A Gym-Like API makes some popular RL-based algorithm repos, like [Stable Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3), easily implemented in our environments.
```python
import SpaceRobotEnv
import numpy as np

env = SpaceRobotEnv.SpaceRobotState()

dimu = env.action_space.shape
print(dimu)
dimo = env.observation_space['observation'].shape
print(dimo)


observation = env.reset()
max_action = env.action_space.high
print('max_action:',max_action)
print('mmin_action',env.action_space.low)
for e_step in range(20):
    observation = env.reset()
    for i_step in range(50):
        env.render()
        # print(observation)
        # action = env.action_space.sample()
        action = np.random.uniform(low=-1.0, high=1.0, size=(dimu,))
        observation, reward, done, info = env.step(max_action * action)

env.close()

```

## Introduction of free-floating space robot

The free-floating space robot contains two parts, a robotic arm and a base satellite. The robot arm is rigidly connected with the base, and the whole space robot remains in a low-gravity condition.
The 6-DoF UR5 model is chosen as the robot arm, and to simplify, we considered the base as a cubic structure. The specific structure is shown as follows.
